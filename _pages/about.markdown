Hi. My name is Paul Vinell and this is my blog. However, blogs typically imply some form of activity, and I will make no such promises. I think a better way to conceptualize this is a space for me to encapsulate projects, thoughts, and experiences for future reference. I guess I am tired of losing projects to the passing of time.

### Education
* 2017-2020. Degree Programme in Computer Science and Engineering (BSc). KTH.
* 2020-*present*. Master's Programme in Machine Learning (MSc). KTH.

### Work
* 2018-*present*. Software developer. T2 Data AB.
  * Full stack and microservice development.

### (Favorite) Programming languages
I'm flexible and used to taking on new languages. I have worked to some degree with most common languages, but I prefer:
* Ruby
  * The best language out there. Rapid development, satisfying syntax, and is even fairly quick nowadays.
* Python
  * This one is kind of a must for data analysis and machine learning.
* Java
  * It's just pleasing to the eye and is fast too. If I need a language with some structure to it I will use Java.

### My history with computers
* Began using the computer (Windows 98) around age 4-5.
* First got internet at age 7.
* Was for some ungodly reason drawn to Windows batch scripts.
* When I turned 12 a friend of my dad's got me a copy of Visual Studio 2010. I used this to learn Visual Basic because C# had scary curly brackets {}.
* From age 12 to 13 I mostly did fun Visual Basic projects and wrote bot scripts for RuneScape (game) botting clients (illicit automation software).
* From age 13 to 15 I developed Minecraft "hacks" (game cheats). I did a terrible job at monetizing this and made like $200 from around 200 000 total downloads of my software (only counting my own download links). However, I mostly did this for fun.
* Lacking inspiration, from age 15 to 18 I mostly did occasional, small projects (if that even).
* At age 19 I began university and now I get to code whether I have an idea for a project or not.

I would not exactly say that I am a computer person and I am not terribly fascinated with their inner workings. I am more interested in the algorithmic and structural side of things, optimizing and planning out good ways to approach a problem. It is also for this reason that I am interested in machine learning - the potential to approximate any function and algorithm.
