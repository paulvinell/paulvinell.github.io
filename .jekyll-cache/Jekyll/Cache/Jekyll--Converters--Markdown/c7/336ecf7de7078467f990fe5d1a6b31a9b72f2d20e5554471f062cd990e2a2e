I"³<p>Sometimes when bored out of your skull your mind threatens to do the world the disservice of creating a space for your views and opinions.
Weâ€™ve all been there. Sometimes youâ€™re even so bored that you go through with it.
This often comes with some sort of false promise to yourself that youâ€™ll most definitely do something productive with it.
We know thatâ€™s not really the case, but acknowledging it as a lie is no fun.</p>
